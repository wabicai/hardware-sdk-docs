# Getting Started Overview

These articles provide the minimum knowledge you need before touching any advanced topic.

1. **Connection Options Overview** - Understand when to choose WebUSB, Web BLE, Common Connect, or QR-code signing.
2. **Environment Setup and Initialization** - Install the correct package for your platform and run the bootstrap code.
3. **Hardware SDK Quickstart** - Perform the first end-to-end flow: detect a device, cache identifiers, and run an example signing call.
4. **Device Events and UI Interaction** - Learn how PIN requests, passphrase prompts, and confirmation dialogs surface through the SDK so you can mirror them in your UI.

Complete these four steps to establish the baseline integration. When you are ready to explore platform-specific transports or advanced security, pivot to the Advanced section. If you prefer a decision-tree experience, the "Developer Guide" inside the Beginner Guides provides a survey-driven orientation.
