# Transport Recipes

Pick the guide that matches your target environment. Each recipe links to a working example inside the `hardware-js-sdk` repository.

| Transport | Use this for | Documentation | Example project |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Common Connect (WebUSB / native host) | Browser apps, native shells (iOS/Android) | [Common Connect](common-connect.md) | `hardware-js-sdk/packages/connect-examples/expo-playground`, `native-ios-example`, `native-android-example` |
| React Native BLE | Bluetooth integration in React Native apps | [React Native BLE](react-native-ble.md) | `hardware-js-sdk/packages/connect-examples/native-android-example` |

Once you have followed the relevant recipe, continue with the [Quick Start](../quick-start.md) API flow and the [Hardware SDK Reference](../references/hardware-sdk/README.md) for chain-specific commands.
