# Beginner Guides Overview

This section helps new integrators understand the OneKey hardware ecosystem and decide on a practical implementation path.

Recommended reading order:

1. **Developer Guide** - A questionnaire-style checklist that clarifies product goals, compliance needs, and deployment assumptions.
2. **Hardware Integration Guide** - Architectural guidance for the standard WebUSB workflow, including security, monitoring, and rollout advice.
3. **Common Connect Quickstart** - A primer on reusing `@onekeyfe/hd-common-connect-sdk` across multiple platforms to avoid duplicate transport implementations.

After finishing these guides you should be able to:

- Choose the appropriate connection method and SDK combination for your scenario.
- Understand the event model and the security prompts that accompany hardware interactions.
- Proceed confidently to "Integration Walkthroughs" for the detailed end-to-end tutorials.

If questions arise while executing the steps, cross-reference the "Getting Started" articles for environment setup and the "Advanced" section for specialized transports or platform adaptations.
