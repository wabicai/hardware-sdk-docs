# QR-code Quickstart

Air Gap signing relies exclusively on QR-code data transfer. The hardware device becomes a dedicated signer with Bluetooth and USB disabled. Use this quickstart to prototype the workflow.

> Air Gap is currently supported on OneKey Pro.

## Example

See the Ethereum example in "QR-code Wallet Integration" for an end-to-end walkthrough.
