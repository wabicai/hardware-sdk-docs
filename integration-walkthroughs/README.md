# Integration Walkthroughs

This area mirrors Ledger's "Integration Walkthroughs" and concentrates on the primary WebUSB journey. Follow the steps here to stand up a working hardware-signing experience before branching into advanced transports.

Recommended path:

1. Review the prerequisites in "Hardware SDK Walkthrough Overview".
2. Complete the "WebUSB Integration Walkthrough" to sign your first transaction.
3. When you need BLE, native, or QR-code transports, jump to the Advanced section which hosts specialized guides.

Keep these walkthroughs lean-treat them as runbooks you can execute repeatedly in staging environments while iterating on UX and security prompts.
