# References Overview

Use this section as the primary index for OneKey API documentation.

- **Hardware SDK APIs** - Device discovery, account operations, chain-specific signing, and device management.
- **Air Gap SDK APIs** - UR encoding details, QR-code chunking rules, and offline signing structures.
- **Shared parameters and error codes** - Read `common-params.md`, `path.md`, and `error-code.md` first so every API call uses the same conventions.

Pair these references with the Beginner Guides if you are working across multiple platforms-the Common Connect quickstart explains how to reuse the same API surface everywhere.
